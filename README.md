# Space-X-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction

Project Description:
The main goal of this project is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX prides itself in being able to reuse the first stage of a rocket launch so much so that they advertise on their website that their rocket launches cost 62 million while other providers cost upward 165 million. Much of these savings are down to the first stage's reusability. If we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This brings us to our main question that we are trying to answer: For a given set of features about a Falcon 9 rocket launch, will the first stage of the rocket land successfully?

The methodolgy followed will include Data Dollection, Data Wrangling and Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization and finally, Machine Learning Prediction.

During our investigation, the results of our analysis indicate that there are some features of rocket launches that have a correlation with the success or failure launches.

In the end we conclude that the Decision Tree may be the best machine learning algorithm for this problem.
